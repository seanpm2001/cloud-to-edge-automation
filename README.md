# Skyway Automation


This is an Ansible repo to contain automation for the Skyway project.  

# Metaclient

There is a Dockerfile in this repo that may be used to build a more advanced
starting point for this automation.  The will pre-load some useful CLIs and
local binaries that will then already be present on the container and therefore
save some steps.
